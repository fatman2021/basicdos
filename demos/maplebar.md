## Introducing BASIC-DOS

The first version of BASIC-DOS (aka "Project Maple Bar") is currently under
development.  The target release date is August 12, 2021.

Check out the following demos:

 1. [Single 25x80 session](demos/?autoStart=true)
 2. [Two 40-column sessions](demos/?autoMount=%7B%20A:%7B%20name:%22BASIC-DOS2%22%7D%7D)
 3. [Two 80-column sessions](demos/?autoMount=%7B%20A:%7B%20name:%22BASIC-DOS3%22%7D%7D)
 4. [Dual monitors (two sessions)](demos/dual/)
 5. [Dual monitors (four sessions)](demos/dual/multi/)

The 40 and 80-column demos are configured with borders.  A double-wide border
indicates which session has keyboard focus.  Use **SHIFT-TAB** to toggle focus.

Please do not share any of these pages.  Like maple bars, a product should not
be shared until it's fully baked and ready to eat.
