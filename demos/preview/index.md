## Introducing BASIC-DOS

The first version of BASIC-DOS (aka "Project Maple Bar") is currently under
development.  The target release date is August 12, 2021.

A [Preview](part1/) is now available.  There are also a couple of old
[Blog](../blog/) posts that provide some additional context, but the
blog has been neglected and could probably use a fresh start.

NOTE: Please do not share any of these pages.  Like maple bars, a product
should not be shared until it's fully baked and ready to be consumed.
