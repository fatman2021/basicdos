CLS
Clears the session using the background color and moves the cursor to the top left corner.

COLOR *foreground*[,*background*[,*border*]]
Sets the foreground (0-15), background (0-15), and border (0-255) colors of the session.
For blinking colors, use 8-15 for *background* and 128-255 for *border*.

DATE [*date*] [/P]
Sets the system date (or prompts for a date if /P) and then displays the date.
The date must be entered as M-D-Y or M/D/Y, where M is 1-12, D is 1-31, and Y is 0-99 or 1980-2099.
If D or Y are omitted, current values are assumed.

DEF *function*(*parms*)[=expression]
Defines a function expression or function block.  Function expressions must fit on a single line and can be defined at any time.
Function blocks may contain multiple lines and must end with a RETURN.  The function name does not need to begin with FN.

DEFDBL [*letter(s)*]
Defines the first letter(s) of variables that will default to double-precision floating-point values.
NOTE: Until floating-point support is added, all numeric variables are integers, all integers are 32-bit (see MAXINT), and all floating-point values will be double-precision.

DEFINT [*letter(s)*]
Defines the first letter(s) of variables that will default to integer values.
NOTE: Until floating-point support is added, all numeric variables are integers, all integers are 32-bit (see MAXINT), and all floating-point values will be double-precision.

DEFSNG [*letter(s)*]
Defines the first letter(s) of variables that will default to single-precision floating-point values.
NOTE: Until floating-point support is added, all numeric variables are integers, all integers are 32-bit (see MAXINT), and all floating-point values will be double-precision.

DEFSTR [*letter(s)*]
Defines the first letter(s) of variables that will default to string values.  Unless DEFSTR is used, all string variables must be defined using the $ suffix.

DIR [*filespec*]
Displays a directory listing of all files matching the given *filespec* (or all files if none is specified).

ECHO [ON|OFF]
Controls the echo of lines in a BAT file.

EXIT
Exits the interpreter if there is a previously loaded copy.

GOTO *label*
Transfers program control to the line with the specified label number.

HELP [*command*]
Displays help for the specified *command*.

IF *expression* THEN *command*
Evaluates the *expression*, and if it is TRUE (non-zero), then the *command* is executed.

KEYS
CTRL-A  Home   CTRL-F  End\
CTRL-E  Up     CTRL-X  Down\
CTRL-S  Left   CTRL-D  Right\
CTRL-G  Del    CTRL-V  Ins\
CTRL-C  Abort  ESC     Erase
CTRL-ALT-DEL is currently disabled. Use RESTART to restart the system.

LET *variable*=*expression*
Assigns the value of the *expression* to the *variable*.  Values cannot be assigned to predefined variables.

LIST
Lists all lines of the currently loaded BAS or BAT program.

LOAD *file*
Loads the specified BAS or BAT file.

MAXINT
Constant equal to the largest positive integer.

MEM
Displays used and available memory.

NEW
Erases the loaded program, functions, and variables.

PRINT
Prints a comma or semi-colon separated series of values.

REM
Used for program remarks.  The rest of the line is not executed.

RESTART
Restarts ("reboots") the system.

RETURN [*expression*]
Ends a function block and returns the specified *expression*.

RND%(N)
Generates a random integer between 0 and MAXINT, inclusive.

RUN
Runs the currently loaded BAS or BAT file.
Program files can also be run without the RUN command.
If no file extension is specified, files with COM, EXE, BAT, and BAS extensions are checked, in that order.

TIME [*time*] [/D] [/P]
Sets the system time (or prompts for a time if /P) and then displays the time. /D displays elapsed time.
The time must be entered as H:M:S.D, where where H is 0-23, M is 0-59, S is 0-59, and D is 0-99.
If M, S, or D are omitted, zeros are assumed.

TYPE *file*
Displays the contents of the specified file.

VER
Displays the BASIC-DOS version number and revision.

Unsupported Commands
The BASIC-DOS file system is currently read-only.  Until read-write support is implemented, the following commands cannot be supported:
COPY, DEL, EDIT, REN, SAVE.
