This is the "history" of the BASIC-DOS, the first version of DOS that *might*
have been created for the IBM PC.

In this alternate timeline, the year is 1980, but we also have the remarkable
ability to see more clearly into the future.  For example, we suspect that
within just a few years, higher capacity diskettes and hard disks will become
popular, and so maybe we can make some early design decisions about the FAT
file system that will smooth the way for those improvements.

We also predict that people will be looking for ways to multitask more
effectively with their PCs.  They may not only want to run programs in the
background (like TSRs) but also be able to switch between two or more
foreground programs.

We've also noticed interesting similarities between DOS and BASIC, which
both include command interpreters.  It seems clear the DOS command interpreter
will want to become more like BASIC, featuring a "batch" language with
variables, and commands like:

 - ECHO (PRINT)
 - FOR
 - GOTO
 - IF
 - PAUSE (INPUT)
 - REM
 - SET (LET)

If only we could have some sort of "combined" interpreter that not only
eliminated the overhead of two separate interpreters but was also more powerful than either interpreter by itself.

The BASIC interpreter is a great productivity tool, but it would be even
greater if:

 - it was faster
 - it wasn't limited to 64K
 - it supported 32-bit integers

32-bit integer support is just one example of how BASIC could take *full*
advantage of the 8088 processor, instead of perpetuating limitations found on
other platforms (eg, 6502 and 8080-based systems).

Finally, BASIC comes with its own built-in full-screen text editor, yet
sadly that editor is suitable only for BASIC files.  What if it could do more,
without reimplementing all the basic line-editing features that are also built
into the operating system?  We know we could ship a really lame editor, like
EDLIN, but maybe we could do better....
