This is the "history" of the BASICDOS, the first version of DOS that *might*
have been created for the IBM PC.

In this alternate timeline, the year is 1980, but we also have the remarkable
ability to see more clearly into the future.  For example, we suspect that
within just a few years, higher capacity diskettes and hard disks will become
popular, and so maybe we can make some early design decisions about the FAT
file system that will smooth the way for those improvements.

We also predict that people will be constantly looking for ways to multitask
more effectively with their PCs.  They'll be looking for ways to run programs
in the background, using TSRs, and toggling between two or more foreground
programs, using crude task-switchers.

We've also noticed some interesting similarities between DOS and BASIC, which
both include command interpreters.  And it seems clear the DOS command
interpreter will want to become more like BASIC, featuring a "batch" language
with variables and commands like:

 - ECHO (PRINT)
 - FOR
 - GOTO
 - IF
 - PAUSE (INPUT)
 - REM
 - SET (LET)

and so on.  If only we could have some sort of "combined" interpreter that
not only eliminated the overhead of two separate interpreters but was also
more powerful than either interpreter by itself.

BASIC is a great built-in productivity tool, which would be even greater if:

 - it was faster (MUCH faster)
 - it wasn't limited to 64K
 - it supported 32-bit ("long") integers, not just 16-bit integers

In other words, BASIC should take *full* advantage of the 8088 processor,
instead of perpetuating limitations inherent in other microprocessors at the
time (eg, the 6502 and 8080).

In addition, BASIC comes with its own built-in full-screen text editor, yet
sadly that editor is suitable only for BASIC files.  What if it could do more,
without reimplementing all the basic line-editing features that are also built
into the operating system?  We know we could ship a really lame editor, like
EDLIN, but maybe we could do better....
