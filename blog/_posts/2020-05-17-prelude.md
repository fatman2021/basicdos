This is the "history" of the BASICDOS, the first version of DOS that *might* have been created for the
IBM PC.

In this alternate timeline, the year is 1980, and we have the remarkable ability to see more clearly
into the future.  For example, we can see that within just a few years, higher capacity diskettes and
hard disks will become popular, and so maybe we can make some early design decisions about the FAT file
system that will smooth the way for those improvements.

We also predict that people will be constantly looking for ways to multitask more effectively with their
PCs.  They'll be looking for ways to run programs in the background, using TSRs, and toggling between
two or more foreground programs, using crude task-switchers.

We've also noticed some interesting similarities between DOS and BASIC.  BASIC has a BASIC interpreter,
DOS has a command interpreter.  And it seems clear that the DOS command interpreter will want to become more
like BASIC, featuring a "batch" language with variables and commands like FOR, IF, GOTO, and PR... -- um,
ECHO.  If only we could instead have some sort of "combined" interpreter that not only eliminated the overhead,
learning curve, etc, of two separate interpreters but was also inherently more powerful than either interpreter
alone.

In addition, it's been popular for BASIC to come with its own built-in full-screen editor, and yet sadly
such an editor is usually suitable only for BASIC files.  What if it could do more?  We know we could ship
a really lame editor, like EDLIN, but maybe we could do better.
