This is the "history" of the BASICDOS, the first version of DOS that *might* have been created for the
IBM PC.

In this alternate timeline, the year is 1980, and we have the remarkable ability to see more clearly
into the future.  For example, we can see that within just a few years, higher capacity diskettes and
hard disks will become popular, and so maybe we can make some early design decisions about the FAT file
system that will smooth the way for those improvements.

We also predict that people will be constantly looking for ways to multitask more effectively with their
PCs.  They'll be looking for ways to run programs in the background, using TSRs, and toggling between
two or more foreground programs, using crude task-switchers.

We've also noticed there are a lot of similarities between DOS and BASIC.  BASIC has a BASIC interpreter,
DOS has a command interpreter.  It seems clear that the DOS command interpreter will want to become more
like BASIC, featuring a "batch" language with variables and commands like FOR, IF, GOTO, and ECHO.  If only
there was some way we could leverage one interpreter to help build the other....

In addition, we have a version of BASIC with a built-in full-screen editor (of a sort), which is sadly only
suitable for BASIC files.  What if it could do more?  We know we could ship a really lame editor, like EDLIN,
but maybe we can do better....
